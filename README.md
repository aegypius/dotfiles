Dotfiles
========

This is my dotfiles storage

## Installation

### Using homesick


```shell
homesick symlink aegypius/dotfiles
```

### Extending bash

You can extend everything in ```.bash.d``` using a simple file using the following format :
```~/.bash_<bash.d filename to extend>```.

For example:

 -  ```~/.bash.d/aliases``` is extended with ```~/.bash_aliases```
 -  ```~/.bash.d/functions``` is extended with ```~/.bash_functions```
